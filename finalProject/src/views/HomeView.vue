            title: "Beyond Request/Response: Why and how we should change the way we build web applications",
            desc: "As web developers, we have been building web applications the same way for 25 years. We send a request, and we receive a response. We might get a whole page back, or we might get some data to render, but the common thread for almost every web application that has ever been built is the request/response cycle. What if we did not have to do it this way? What kind possibilities would open up to us?",

You will get hands-on practice scaling an app to multiple pages using routing and state management libraries. At the end of this workshop, you will be ready to build complex and responsive front-end applications.",

            desc: "Web components have been around for a long time (since HTML 5 became a thing), but there has not been a lot of attention given to them until recently. Now, tech organizations worldwide are adopting them and finding tremendous efficiency in creating framework-agnostic reusable components to build their Design System component libraries and applications.",

            desc: "As developers, we spend much of our time debugging apps - often code we didn't even write. Sadly, few developers have ever been taught how to approach debugging - it's something most of us learn through painful experience. The good news is you _can_ learn how to debug effectively, and there's several key techniques and tools you can use for debugging JS and React apps.",

            title: "Designing Effective Unit Tests for React",
            desc: "React has great tools for Unit Testing component. This does not mean testing is easy. There are still a lot of questions you have to figure out for yourself: How many component tests should you write vs end-to-end tests or lower-level unit tests? How can you test a certain line of code that is tricky to test? And what in the world are you supposed to do about that persistent act() warning?",

            desc: "This session is a \"re-introduction\" to async and await. It covers what the keywords mean and - just as importantly - what they *don't* mean. We'll be covering What You Need To Know, including several different conceptual models of async/await that you can switch between at will. This refresher course will take a look at the common async best practices with a careful examination of why they're best practices and when to ignore the best practices. We'll be including some semi-advanced topics (specifically ValueTasks, asynchronous disposal, and Channels) to round out techniques for modern asynchronous development.",

            desc: "For the past few years, Flutter has revolutionized mobile app development by allowing developers to build high-performance, cross-platform applications with ease. However, building a full-stack application can be a challenging task because we often find ourselves juggling multiple technologies to solve problems across an application stack.",

            desc: "Today's solutions for cross platform development all aim to provide developers a better way to build their apps. Build your app in a certain way, and you can ship it to multiple targets (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) with ease. But not all solutions are created equal, and it can be difficult to understand the benefits of one solution over another.",

With these tools, we will be able to create a beautiful and efficient wear app that can help you track your health goals!",
